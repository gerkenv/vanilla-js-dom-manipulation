#Vanilla JS DOM manipulation
Based on [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ik6X4DJKCc).

## DOM
Document object model represented by a tree structure, containing a couple of main nodes:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
That's it, every thing else is optional.
